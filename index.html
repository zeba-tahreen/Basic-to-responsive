                    Hello Everyone !!! Welcome to my Page ... 
                    <br>
                    I'm Zeba and I am based from India, I'm a fashion designer who is a great food lover
                    (kind of good cook as well) and always passionate to learn and upgrade myself with new knowledge.
                    Currently I'm working in Amazon as a "Associate", I have been with Amazon since more than
                    a year now and I love my work.</p>   
                 <p>I came in contact to programming a few years ago when I worked under a Programmer as an
                    "Content Curator and social media manager" for their website named "WedNeeds". I was very
                    curious to know what he is doing on that black screen (Terminal), because I was already learning
                    Fashion Designing and also I was told "Programming is needs years of computer science study" I
                    skipped it and move on with my passion of clothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, In US when I saw that "Rutgers Bootcamps" are offering a "Full Stack Development" course
                    which doesn't require years of computer science study my becoming a programmer hope came to light.
                    I am all set for new education and challenges to make myself ready to step into the world of Tech
                    as "Full Stack Developer".
